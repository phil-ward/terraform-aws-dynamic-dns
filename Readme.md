# Terraform AWS Dynamic DNS

## Intro

This module is an implementation of the Serverless Dynamic DNS System as presented in the AWS Startups blog:

[Building a serverless dynamic DNS system with AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/startups/how-to-build-a-serverless-dynamic-dns-system-with-aws/)

However, I opted to re-implement this solution with Terraform instead of the AWS CDK.

## Other Notes

This module is currently in a very rough draft stage, not to be used for any production workloads.
